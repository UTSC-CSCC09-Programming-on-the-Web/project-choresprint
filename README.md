### Description of Web Application
SkillMatch is a web platform that enables users to exchange skills directly with others. Users create a profile, listing the skills they are proficient in and can teach alongside the ones they want to learn. The platform includes a searchable directory of user profiles, allowing users to filter by skill, availability, and location.

These ratings will appear on profiles to help users select reliable partners.
